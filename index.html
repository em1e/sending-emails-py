<h1>Dear Mr. $name,</h1>
<p>It has come to my attention that you have been intruding into our organization’s upcoming conference by redirecting our event’s contracted hotel rooms to your organization despite your organization not being involved with our event.
This letter is to request that you immediately cease and desist from pirating those rooms. Your improper intrusion into our event may result in a civil law suit for tortious interference with contract and/or tortious interference with business relations. The financial consequence of these actions could result in your company being charged with paying all of our attrition penalties alongside other financial loss that we incur as a result of your intrusion.
I oversee the management of intellectual property and brand for the Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA). We have very strict guidelines as to how and where our intellectual property can be used. We also benefit from the protection afforded us by Federal law and the regulations of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As such, the attached Conference Locate screenshot came to my attention. Our records do not show an approval for your use of the PCMA name and your company appears to be infringing on protected intellectual property.
This letter is to formally request that you immediately cease using our intellectual property, remove all references to it in current and future materials and notify your affiliated person and company to do the same.
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation on this request. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.
  
Sincerely,

Toodoloo F. Ornow
